## utils for some operations on sets

 * [intersect two sorted arrays](https://github.com/surr-name/sets-utils/tree/master/bin/intersectTwoSortedArrays)
    * time complexity is `O(n)`, where `n` in worst case is length of the longest array.
 * [intersect several sorted arrays](https://github.com/surr-name/sets-utils/tree/master/bin/intersectSeveralSortedArrays)
    * time complexity is `O(m * n)`, where `m` is quantity of the arrays, `n` in worst case is length of the longest array.
 * [find subset of elements that starts from given substring](https://github.com/surr-name/sets-utils/tree/master/bin/findSubsetIncludingSubstringFromWordStart)
    * time complexity is `O(log n)`, where `n` is length of the given sorted array
