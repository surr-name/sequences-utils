## utils for some operations on sequences

 * [intersect two sorted arrays](https://github.com/surr-name/sequences-utils/tree/master/bin/intersectTwoSortedArrays)
    * time complexity is `O(n)`, where `n` is sum of lengthes of both arrays in worst case.
 * [intersect several sorted arrays](https://github.com/surr-name/sequences-utils/tree/master/bin/intersectSeveralSortedArrays)
    * time complexity is `O(m * n)`, where `m` is quantity of the arrays, `n` in worst case is length of the longest array.
 * [merge two sorted arrays](https://github.com/surr-name/sequences-utils/tree/master/bin/mergeTwoSortedArrays)
    * time complexity is `O(n)`, where `n` is sum of lengthes of both arrays in worst case.
 * [merge several sorted arrays](https://github.com/surr-name/sequences-utils/tree/master/bin/mergeSeveralSortedArrays)
    * time complexity is `O(n * m * log m)`, where `n` is average length of the arrays, `m` is quantity of the arrays.
 * [find subsequence of elements that starts from given substring](https://github.com/surr-name/sequences-utils/tree/master/bin/findSubsequenceIncludingSubstringFromWordStart)
    * time complexity is `O(log n)`, where `n` is length of the given sorted array.
